# print("Data Structures and Algorithms Series with Chai Aur Code!")

# DataStructures-> data is like raw information and to store that data properly we require a structure so data can not be leaked which is called data-structure. 

# Algorithms :- these are set of instructions to solve a problem


#  Time Complexity:- 

#  Simple operations → O(1)
# • One loop over n → O(n)
# • Two loops in sequence → O(n)
# • Nested loops → multiply complexities (e.g., O(n²), O(nm))
# • Loop where value doubles/halves → O(log n)
# • Growth order: O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n²)
